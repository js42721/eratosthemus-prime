Eratosthemus Prime
==================
Eratosthemus Prime transforms your ordinary numbers into pure prime awesomeness.
He crushes composites under his wheels of mod 30 factorization. When the
pressure is on, he multiplies himself by activating __Multithread Mode__ so he
can  grind those composites to dust even faster. Get yours while supplies last.

<sub><sup>Works up to 2<sup>64</sup> - 1. Requires gcc with OpenMP support.
