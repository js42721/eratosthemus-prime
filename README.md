Eratosthemus Prime
==================
Eratosthemus Prime transforms your ordinary numbers into __pure prime awesomeness__.
He crushes composites under his wheels of __mod 30 factorization__.
When the pressure is on, he multiplies himself by activating __Multithread Mode__
so he can grind those composites to dust *even faster!!!*
